## Techinical Aspects

Files are grouped according to features [(the "ducks" pattern)](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#structure-files-as-feature-folders-with-single-file-logic). The `app` folder contains the main `App`.

- **State management:** Redux + RTK for global states, `useContext` + `useImmerReducer` + `useState` for more local states
- **Data fetching**: Built a fetch client with vanilla JavaScript `fetch` (see the `fetch` folder) and used inside action creator thunks.
- **Styling**: vainlla CSS (flexbox, grid, animations) with full responsiveness, as well as some SVGs for aesthetics. CSS injected with Styled Components,

The repo was initiated from my own [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/NokTNL/react-boilerplate) to save some precious time on downloading packages.

## Tests

Manual testing was performed. See the `src/test` folder for more explanation.
